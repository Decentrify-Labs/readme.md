Decentrify Labs pioneers decentralized infrastructure for AI memory, storage, and identity management. We build systems that empower users with true ownership and control over their data through blockchain technology, cryptographic security, and distributed storage.

## Mission

We build decentralized infrastructure that empowers users with true ownership and control over their data, identity, and AI interactions. Our systems leverage blockchain technology, cryptographic security, and distributed storage to ensure users remain sovereign over their digital assets.

**Core Principles:**
- Users own their data through a cryptographic wallet-based identity
- Privacy is fundamental with end-to-end encryption by default
- Memory is persistent across applications and platforms
- Transactions are transparent while maintaining user confidentiality

## Featured Projects

### DeMemo - Decentralized AI Memory Infrastructure

[Repository](https://github.com/Decentrify-Labs/Dememo) | [Documentation](https://github.com/Decentrify-Labs/Dememo#readme) | [Smart Contract](https://github.com/Decentrify-Labs/Dememo/blob/main/src/contracts/MemoryStorage.sol)

DeMemo is our flagship enterprise-grade decentralized AI memory layer that establishes a new paradigm for how AI systems store and retrieve conversational context. Built on Arc Network, it provides wallet-based identity, end-to-end encryption, and permanent decentralized storage through IPFS.

**Key Features:**

- **Wallet-Based Authentication** - Self-custody identity via MetaMask & Circle Wallets
- **End-to-End Encryption** - AES-256-GCM client-side encryption
- **IPFS Storage** - Permanent decentralized storage through Pinata
- **Blockchain Indexing** - Immutable on-chain memory references on Arc Network
- **AI Integration** - Contextual AI with Groq models and persistent memory
- **Microtransactions** - Cost-effective at 0.01 USDC per memory record

**Technology Stack:**
```
Frontend:    Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
Blockchain:  Arc Network, ethers.js v6
Storage:     Pinata IPFS
AI:          Groq (BYOK Architecture)
Encryption:  Web Crypto API (AES-256-GCM)

## Why Decentrify Labs

**User Sovereignty**

We believe users should have complete control over their data, identity, and digital interactions without relying on centralized intermediaries.

**Privacy-First Design**

All our systems are architected with privacy as a core principle, utilizing end-to-end encryption and zero-knowledge proofs where applicable.

**Blockchain-Native**

We leverage blockchain technology not just for tokens, but for creating immutable, transparent, and trustless systems.

**Innovation-Driven**

We push the boundaries of what's possible by combining AI, blockchain, and decentralized storage in novel ways.

**Open Source Commitment**

We believe in building in public and contributing to the broader Web3 and AI ecosystems.
